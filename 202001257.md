# Q.1. Identify FRs and NFRs:

# Functional Requirements of LIS:

* To borrow a book (or return it) for members of LIS we need to encorporate sign-in option.
* A notification system should be employed that should remind the user before a day oof returning the book.
* For a user to sign up the password should be of atleast 8 characters with conditions like atleast one number and special symbol.
* Administrative privileges should be given to the librarian so he or she can manage, add, delete or modify any of the transactions made.
* Search bar and filters to that search bar should be included that will help the users to search for the books they are looking for and make their work easier.

# Non-Functional Requirements LIS:
* The system should be able to handle errors and be crash recoverable.
* The system needs to be scalable to work well even when the number of users incereases.
* Modern security enryption techniques should be implemented to protect the data about the users and books.
* The system should be concurrent. It should be able to handle more than 1 user trying to access the site at a time.
* The time taken for the system to load should be less than 1 second.
* The website should be usable and readable. The UI of the system should be simple enought to understand.
* The website should be made using HTML5 an LAN ethernet services should be available in order to access the website from only inside the campus.

# Q.2. Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.

# Scope:
* This application will be helpful to people who have any kind of hearing disability or ADHD disorder.
* It could prove to be useful for the family members of the people in the above point.
* It could also be accessible to some normal person if he/she finds it extra safe and useful.

# Features:

* This app is optimized for Android with low-latency so that it works in real-time for use.
* The mobile application uses artificial intelligence to recognize key sound events of interest
* This app is optimized for Android with low-latency so that it works in real-time for use.
* It also notifies on the sound of a person and you can save that information as a person's name.

# Non-Functional Requirements:

* Since it would be running in the background all the time, it should consume less battery.
* It should be fast. It needs to produce sound within milliseconds as it's critical for a person with hearing aid.
* The system should be scalable to accomodate increasing number of users.
* It should be error free and crash recoverable as someone's life might be dependent on this.
